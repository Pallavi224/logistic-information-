In order to ensure the security of logistics information and to query information quickly and efficiently, using searchable encryption algorithms, combined with the characteristics of the blockchain, a searchable and encrypted logistics information blockchain data query algorithm is proposed. First, the logistics information is divided into multiple data files, encrypted with an asymmetric searchable encryption algorithm, and then stored in the cloud server. The keyword index value is extracted from each data file and uploaded to the blockchain. This solution can be used at any time Update and query data. Finally, analyze the correctness, completeness and safety of the scheme of this article, which proves the feasibility of this scheme.
